          <p> I’m Heather Jansen. I’m an award-winning designer based in Oakland with over eight years of
experience in brand storytelling and collaborating across teams to design user-focused products.
 <br><br>
I am brave and take risks, and doing so is the only reason I have gotten to where I am today. One example is my return
to design as my second career in 2013. I have also recently completed a UX Bootcamp to solidify my web expertise. Doing so 
confirmed design is my thing, agnostic of form. I’m adaptable and know how to make a path forward. 
<br> <br>
One of my first jobs was answering 1-800 hotline calls for Ball Canning. It taught me how to problem-solve on the spot and 
also gave me great empathy for users. When I worked internationally with National Geographic licensing brand and book publishing 
rights in other languages, I carried that thinking with me. I lean on that knowledge now when I advocate for user-testing and research analyzation 
that ensure products are made for the people using them.
<br> <br>
I am a collaborator at heart. Working with others motivates me, but I also know from experience
that a genuine team effort makes a more significant product. I believe that helping others
succeed, having a positive outlook, and thinking of the big picture leads to more success for everyone. 
<br> <br> 
I am a curious self-starter; I never stop learning and I’m good at it. I am fueled by figuring out how things work 
and then finding ways to make them better. I love the discovery and development process of building a brand or experience. 
Troubleshooting code with developers actually sparks joy. Time spent testing button states and interaction makes me tick.
<br><br> 

The secret to my success as a designer is my diverse experience, a proven research and iteration process for achieving 
results and my relationship building skills. I'm recognized as resourceful, a great mentor and group facilitator and a clear communicator. 
          
<br><br>I'm currently unlearning the use of a double space after punctuation. ;)

<p><span id="fun">Fun Facts:</span> I'm a Cubs fan, indie music nerd, and an Instagram photographer (much to
  the chagrin of my darkroom loving soul). I can't resist a triple layer chocolate cake. In my free time, I like to sew
  clothing, pet cats, and mentor others.</p>

        <p class="process">When I get stuck whether in my design work or in life, I turn to several of the practices listed in this collage. I gather inspiration everywhere and add them to my moodboards. I take walks or get out in nature to clear my head. I research the topic, ask questions, and run A/B tests on designs with my colleagues. I create phyiscal art by hand with uncommon materials as my medium or scribble in Procreate after a long day.<br><br>Whenever it gets hard, I remind myself to look for the bright spot. It will get better around the corner, if I just stay focused and keep going.<br><br>These tools are crucial for me to produce high-impact design work.</p> </div>
